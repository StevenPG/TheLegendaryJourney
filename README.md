# TheLegendaryJourney
A procedurally generated adventure where you try to get the highest score possible, with characters inspired by our house cats!

## Game Implementation

The game is implemented in the `game` directory as a 2D platformer using Phaser 3, TypeScript, and Vite. See the [game README](game/README.md) for details on how to run and build the game.

### Features

- 2D platformer mechanics with physics and collision detection
- Player movement and jumping
- Configurable game settings through a JSON file
- Sound effects and background music
- Animations for player character
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes

## How to Play

1. Navigate to the `game` directory
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Use arrow keys to move and jump

### Characters

- **Eli**: The main character, a brave and adventurous cat with only three legs. He can double jump.
- **Umbra**: Eli's oldest friend, a big and loud cat that loves to talk. She can scream to hurt enemies.
- **Bucket**: Umbra's childhood terror, a stocky cat that can break through obstacles and enemies.

The game can be customized by editing the `game/public/game-config.json` file. This allows you to change:

- Screen dimensions
- Physics properties
- Player properties (speed, jump force, etc.)
- Platform positions
- Audio settings
